# Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization Plan - Phase 3

## 🎯 **Analysis Summary**

After analyzing the current bundle, I've identified several optimization opportunities:

### **Current Issues Identified**

1. **Large Dependencies**
   - `@mux/mux-player-react` - Heavy video player component
   - `framer-motion` - Animation library
   - `@radix-ui/*` - Multiple UI component libraries
   - `lucide-react` - Icon library

2. **Heavy Components Not Code-Split**
   - Training creation flow (5 steps)
   - Employee training player with video
   - Dashboard components
   - AI tutor chat

3. **Bundle Size Issues**
   - All components loaded on initial page load
   - No lazy loading for heavy features
   - Large vendor chunks

## 📋 **Optimization Strategy**

### **Phase 3.1: Dynamic Imports**
- [ ] Split training creation flow into lazy-loaded steps
- [ ] Lazy load video player components
- [ ] Split dashboard components by role
- [ ] Lazy load AI tutor chat

### **Phase 3.2: Route-Based Code Splitting**
- [ ] Split dashboard routes
- [ ] Split training routes
- [ ] Split employee routes
- [ ] Split auth routes

### **Phase 3.3: Component-Level Splitting**
- [ ] Split heavy UI components
- [ ] Lazy load form components
- [ ] Split chart/analytics components
- [ ] Split file upload components

### **Phase 3.4: Bundle Optimization**
- [ ] Optimize vendor chunks
- [ ] Tree-shake unused code
- [ ] Optimize image loading
- [ ] Implement service worker caching

## 🔍 **Sanity Check Points**
1. **After each optimization**: Test page loading and functionality
2. **Before/after each change**: Measure bundle size
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track loading times
4. **Error monitoring**: Ensure no new errors introduced

## 🚀 **Starting Implementation**
Let's begin with Phase 3.1: Dynamic Imports
