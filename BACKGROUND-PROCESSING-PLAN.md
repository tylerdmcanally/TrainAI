# Background Processing Plan - Phase 4

## üéØ **Analysis Summary**

After analyzing the current processing flow, I've identified these heavy operations that should be moved to background jobs:

### **Current Blocking Operations**

1. **Video Transcription** (2-10 seconds)
   - OpenAI Whisper API calls
   - Large audio file processing
   - Currently blocks the UI

2. **AI Content Generation** (5-15 seconds)
   - GPT-4 SOP generation
   - Chapter creation
   - Key points extraction
   - Currently blocks the UI

3. **Video Upload to Mux** (10-60 seconds)
   - Large video file uploads
   - Video processing on Mux side
   - Currently blocks the UI

4. **Checkpoint Audio Generation** (2-5 seconds)
   - TTS audio generation for checkpoints
   - Currently blocks checkpoint interactions

## üìã **Background Processing Strategy**

### **Phase 4.1: Job Queue System**
- [ ] Implement Supabase Edge Functions for background jobs
- [ ] Create job status tracking in database
- [ ] Build job queue management system
- [ ] Add job retry and error handling

### **Phase 4.2: Background Job APIs**
- [ ] Transcription job API
- [ ] AI generation job API
- [ ] Mux upload job API
- [ ] TTS generation job API

### **Phase 4.3: Real-time Updates**
- [ ] WebSocket or polling for job status
- [ ] Real-time progress indicators
- [ ] Job completion notifications
- [ ] Error handling and retry UI

### **Phase 4.4: Enhanced UI Flow**
- [ ] Non-blocking training creation
- [ ] Background job monitoring
- [ ] Progress tracking across sessions
- [ ] Resume incomplete jobs

## üîç **Sanity Check Points**
1. **After each optimization**: Test job processing and UI responsiveness
2. **Before/after each change**: Verify job status tracking
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track job completion times
4. **Error monitoring**: Ensure proper error handling and recovery

## üöÄ **Starting Implementation**
Let's begin with Phase 4.1: Job Queue System
